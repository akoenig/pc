# Physical Computing - Photoresistor "activates" LED

A circuit with a photoresistor which activates a LED when a given threshold has been overstep.

With other words: If the environment light conditions are dim, then activate the LED.

## Requirements

  * Arduino Uno
  * Breadboard
  * 3x jumper cables
  * 1x 100KÎ© resistors
  * 1x Photoresistor (LDR = Light Dependent Resistor)
  * 1x red LED
